  abstract = {Signal fluctuations in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can result from a number of sources that may have a neuronal, physiologic or instrumental origin. To determine the relative contribution of these sources, we recorded physiological (respiration and cardiac) signals simultaneously with fMRI in human volunteers at rest with their eyes closed. State-of-the-art technology was used including high magnetic field (7 T), a multichannel detector array and high-resolution (3 mm3) echo-planar imaging. We investigated the relative contribution of thermal noise and other sources of variance to the observed fMRI signal fluctuations both in the visual cortex and in the whole brain gray matter. The following sources of variance were evaluated separately: low-frequency drifts due to scanner instability, effects correlated with respiratory and cardiac cycles, effects due to variability in the respiratory flow rate and cardiac rate, and other sources, tentatively attributed to spontaneous neuronal activity. We found that low-frequency drifts are the most significant source of fMRI signal fluctuations (3.0\% signal change in the visual cortex, TE=32 ms), followed by spontaneous neuronal activity (2.9\%), thermal noise (2.1\%), effects due to variability in physiological rates (respiration 0.9\%, heartbeat 0.9\%), and correlated with physiological cycles (0.6\%). We suggest the selection and use of four lagged physiological noise regressors as an effective model to explain the variance related to fluctuations in the rates of respiration volume change and cardiac pulsation. Our results also indicate that, compared to the whole brain gray matter, the visual cortex has higher sensitivity to changes in both the rate of respiration and the spontaneous resting-state activity. Under the conditions of this study, spontaneous neuronal activity is one of the major contributors to the measured fMRI signal fluctuations, increasing almost twofold relative to earlier experiments under similar conditions at 3 T.},

  abstract = {Stroke disrupts the brain's vascular supply, not only within but also outside areas of infarction. We investigated temporal delays (lag) in resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging signals in 130 stroke patients scanned two weeks, three months and 12 months post stroke onset. Thirty controls were scanned twice at an interval of three months. Hemodynamic lag was determined using cross-correlation with the global gray matter signal. Behavioral performance in multiple domains was assessed in all patients. Regional cerebral blood flow and carotid patency were assessed in subsets of the cohort using arterial spin labeling and carotid Doppler ultrasonography. Significant hemodynamic lag was observed in 30\% of stroke patients sub-acutely. Approximately 10\% of patients showed lag at one-year post-stroke. Hemodynamic lag corresponded to gross aberrancy in functional connectivity measures, performance deficits in multiple domains and local and global perfusion deficits. Correcting for lag partially normalized abnormalities in measured functional connectivity. Yet post-stroke FC{\textendash}behavior relationships in the motor and attention systems persisted even after hemodynamic delays were corrected. Resting state fMRI can reliably identify areas of hemodynamic delay following stroke. Our data reveal that hemodynamic delay is common sub-acutely, alters functional connectivity, and may be of clinical importance.},

  abstract = {Recent research has demonstrated the importance of global changes to the functional organization of brain network following stroke. Resting functional magnetic resonance imaging (R-fMRI) is a non-invasive tool that enables the measurement of functional connectivity (FC) across the entire brain while placing minimal demands on the subject. For these reasons, it is a uniquely appealing tool for studying the distant effects of stroke. However, R-fMRI studies rely on a number of premises that cannot be assumed without careful validation in the context of stroke. Here, we describe strategies to identify and mitigate confounds specific to R-fMRI research in cerebrovascular disease. Five main topics are discussed: (a) achieving adequate co-registration of lesioned brains, (b) identifying and removing hemodynamic lags in resting BOLD, (c) identifying other vascular disruptions that affect the resting BOLD signal, (d) selecting an appropriate control cohort, and (e) acquiring sufficient fMRI data to reliably identify FC changes. For each topic, we provide guidelines for steps to improve the interpretability and reproducibility of FC-stroke research. We include a table of confounds and approaches to identify and mitigate each. Our recommendations extend to any research using R-fMRI to study diseases that might alter cerebrovascular flow and dynamics or brain anatomy.},

  abstract = {We examined the effect of lesion on the resting-state functional connectivity in chronic post-stroke patients. We found many instances of strong correlations in BOLD signal measured at different locations within the lesion, making it hard to distinguish from the connectivity between intact and strongly connected regions. Regression of the mean cerebro-spinal fluid signal did not alleviate this problem. The connectomes computed by exclusion of lesioned voxels were not good predictors of the behavioral measures. We came up with a novel method that utilizes Independent Component Analysis (as implemented in FSL MELODIC) to identify the sources of variance in the resting-state fMRI data that are driven by the lesion, and to remove this variance. The resulting functional connectomes show better correlations with the behavioral measures of speech and language, and improve the out-of-sample prediction accuracy of multivariate analysis. We therefore advocate this preprocessing method for studies of post-stroke functional connectivity, particularly in samples with large lesions.,                                        {\textbullet}               fMRI signal is correlated across spatial locations within a post-stroke lesion.                                         {\textbullet}               These high correlations present problems for functional connectivity analysis.                                         {\textbullet}               Regression of mean CSF signal does not solve this issue.                                         {\textbullet}               ICA can be used to successfully remove these artifacts.},
